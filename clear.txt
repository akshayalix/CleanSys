The following batch commands are used to delete all your temp, recent and prefetch files on your System.

Save the following code as "Clear.bat" on your local system

*********START CODE************

@ECHO OFF

del /s /f /q %userprofile%\Recent\*.*

del /s /f /q C:\Windows\Prefetch\*.*

del /s /f /q C:\Windows\Temp\*.*

del /s /f /q %USERPROFILE%\appdata\local\temp\*.*


/Below command to Show the folder after deleted files

Explorer %userprofile%\Recent

Explorer C:\Windows\Prefetch

Explorer C:\Windows\Temp

Explorer %USERPROFILE%\appdata\local\temp


*********END CODE************


del won't trigger any dialogs or message boxes. You have a few problems, though:

start will just open Explorer which would be useless. You need cd to change the working directory of your batch file (the /D is there so it also works when run from a different drive):

cd /D %temp%
You may want to delete directories as well:

for /d %%D in (*) do rd /s /q "%%D"
You need to skip the question for del and remove read-only files too:

del /f /q *
so you arrive at:

@echo off
cd /D %temp%
for /d %%D in (*) do rd /s /q "%%D"
del /f /q *
